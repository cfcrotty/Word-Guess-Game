# Word-Guess-Game
Word Guess Game Homework by Cara Felise


This is a word guessing game like a "Hangman" but for songs. You can listen to the music that plays everytime a new word is generated or use the Hint button to show the original band of each songs. Users just have to load the page, listen to the music for a hint togues what the song is.

The project is useful because it provides an example of languages/technologies I learned and show what I can do as a developer. It is using pure/vanilla Javascript, some HTML and CSS.

For questions or concerns, please go to my website at carafelise.com or send an email at admin@carafelise.com. I maintain and developed this project.
